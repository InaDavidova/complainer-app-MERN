# Complainer App

I created this a MERN application for a 3 days coding challenge. I used React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB. The app is called "Complainer App" and the purpose of it is to allow its users to fill out a complaint form with details about their problem. An image can also be uploaded. Another page is displaying all the data and it's allowing the user to filter it.

#How to  start it?

Make sure you have installed Node.js on your mashine.

Navigate yourself to the server and client folder in 2 different terminals.

- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server folders to start the app
